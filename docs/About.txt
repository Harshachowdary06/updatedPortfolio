<span>Hey there! I’m Harsha — a passionate software engineer who loves turning ideas into real, working code.
I thrive on solving complex problems, building modern web apps, and learning something new every day.
Outside of coding, you’ll probably find me exploring new technologies, sketching UI concepts, or sipping way too much coffee.
Let’s build something awesome together!
